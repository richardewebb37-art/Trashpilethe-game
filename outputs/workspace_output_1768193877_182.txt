=== CHECKING FOR INTEGRATION ISSUES ===
1. Checking for circular dependencies...
/workspace/app/src/main/java/com/trashapp/gcms/handlers/AbilityCommandHandler.kt:5:import com.trashapp.gcms.progression.Ability
/workspace/app/src/main/java/com/trashapp/gcms/handlers/AbilityCommandHandler.kt:6:import com.trashapp.gcms.progression.ProgressionTree
2. Checking for missing method implementations...
        return when (command) {
            is AbilityCommand.UseAbilityCommand -> 
            is AbilityCommand.ActivateSkillEffectCommand -> 
            is AbilityCommand.TrackAbilityUsageCommand -> 
            is AbilityCommand.ResetAbilityUsageCommand -> 
            is AbilityCommand.CheckAbilityAvailableCommand -> 
            is AbilityCommand.GetAbilityRemainingUsesCommand -> 
            is AbilityCommand.PurchaseAbilityCommand -> 
3. Checking for null safety issues...
17:    val icon: String? = null,                // Icon resource name
22:    val skillId: String? = null,             // Parent skill ID (if part of a skill)
32:    val isUnlocked: Boolean = false,          // Is this ability available for purchase?
33:    val isPurchased: Boolean = false,         // Has this ability been purchased?
34:    val isActive: Boolean = false,            // Is this ability currently active?
