### Next Steps (Future Work)

1. **GCMS Integration** - Update commands and events for tiered system
2. **UI Updates** - Redesign progression screens with tier display
3. **Database Integration** - Save/load progression state
4. **Testing** - Comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. **Balance Tuning** - Adjust formulas based on playtesting
6. **Git Commit** - Commit all changes to repository

## Status: CORE SYSTEM COMPLETE ✅

All core tiered progression system components are fully implemented and documented. The system is ready for integration with GCMS, UI, and database layers.
